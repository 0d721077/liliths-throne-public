	You step back and knock on the door, wondering if Lilaya ever actually gets any work done in here as both she and Rose snap round to see who's disturbing them.

	#if($player.isVisiblyPregnant() && $game.getDialogueFlags().reactedToPregnancyLilaya)
		$aunt.speech("Ah, $player.getName()"), Lilaya shouts, clearly taken by surprise at your sudden appearance, $aunt.speech("So, you're ready for more... <i>tests</i>? Wait... Are you <i>pregnant</i>?  Well, if you want help with that, all you have to do is ask!")
	#else
		$aunt.speech("Ah, $player.getName(),") Lilaya shouts, clearly taken by surprise at your sudden appearance, $aunt.speech("So, you're ready for more... <i>tests</i>? Come here!")
	#end

	Rose quickly makes her exit, hurrying past and blushing as you say hello.
	Lilaya motions for you to come and sit down in the chair she just vacated.
