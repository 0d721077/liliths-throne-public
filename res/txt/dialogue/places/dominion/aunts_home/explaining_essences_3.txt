	[lilaya.speech(Ok, so, first thing to know is that these essences are no longer part of the person you took them from. It's not as though you're trapping a part of their soul into enchanted items or anything like that!)] Lilaya starts explaining, [lilaya.speech(So don't have any qualms about using these essences to enchant whatever you want!)]
</p>
<p>
	As she speaks, Lilaya starts gathering ingredients from all around the table, and places them in a little pile in front of you. Producing a bottle of Feline's Fancy from somewhere, she puts it down on the desk next to the ingredients.
</p>
<p>
	[lilaya.speech(Right, well I should probably demonstrate! I still have a couple of cat-morph essences absorbed from some work I was doing earlier, so I might as well use them on this!)] she says, and you notice that her earlier look of worry has been replaced with that of excitement, [lilaya.speech(So, you'll need a particular type of essence to enchant different objects. Seeing as this is a drink for cat-morphs, it reacts only to cat-morph essences. Right, so first, you need an enchanting plate.)]
</p>
<p>
	Lilaya points to a solid metal disk, about half a metre in diameter, that's lying on the floor to one side of you. Bending down, you pick it up and place it on the table. You're surprised at how light it is, and as you take a closer look, you see an intricate pattern of unfamiliar glyphs circling its edge.
</p>
<p>
	[lilaya.speech(Thanks, you'll always need one of these if you want to enchant anything. You need a way to draw the essence out from your aura, and that's exactly what this does!)] Lilaya continues to explain as she places the bottle of Feline's Fancy in the middle of the metal disk, before placing a curious little green gem down next to it, [lilaya.speech(So, you put your base ingredient on the plate, then you can add a couple of little elements. Depending on what elements you choose to add, the resulting item will have different effects. So, once you've decided on what ingredient and elements you're going to use, you put your hands down on the plate like this...)]
</p>
<p>
	Lilaya places her hands down on the edge of the enchanting plate, and you gasp as you suddenly see four little balls of pink energy orbiting her body. As you watch, two of the orbs suddenly shoot down into the plate, and with a bright pink flash, and a wisp of odourless smoke, the Feline's Fancy disappears. In its place, a curious little bottle of red liquid has materialised out of thin-air.
</p>
<p>
	[lilaya.speech(So, you have to sort of feel how much essence you want to pour into the enchantment. The more you put in, the better the resulting item!)] Lilaya picks up the little potion and places it off to one side, [lilaya.speech(and that's all there is to it!)]
