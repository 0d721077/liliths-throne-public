	[pc.speech(You look like you've seen a ghost, what's wrong?)] you ask.

	[lilaya.speech(Ah, well, it's just...)] Lilaya stumbles over her words a little as she responds, [lilaya.speech(you really, <i>really</i> shouldn't be able to do that!)]
</p>
<p>
	Pointing at the ball of energy that's orbiting your aura, she continues, [lilaya.speech(You see that? You've absorbed a piece of someone's essence! There's something seriously wrong with your aura... Normally only Lilin are able to do that, hell, even demons can't absorb essences directly from people!)]

<p>
	[pc.speech(Wait, I absorbed their <i>essence</i>? What does that mean?)]
</p>
<p>
	[lilaya.speech(Well, basically, you absorbed a fragment of someone's aura. It's not harmful to either you or them, so don't worry about that, their aura will replenish itself over time. You see, using essences, like the one you've absorbed, is the way enchantments are infused into objects. Normally, demons have to buy extracted essences in order to absorb them into their aura, but you can <i>somehow</i> absorb them directly from a person, just like a Lilin can! Now that you've absorbed someone's essence, you can focus its energy into enchanting things... Look, it's better if I show you...)]

	Lilaya flicks a switch on one of the instruments, and the shimmering pink aura instantly vanishes from sight. Stepping forwards, she takes you by the [pc.arm] once more, and quickly leads you over to another corner of the lab, where a long, sturdy table is covered in all sorts of alchemical-looking apparatus. Large glass bottles filled with brightly coloured liquids bubble away without any apparent source of heat, and all manner of strange looking ingredients lie scattered over the table's surface. Coming to a halt in front of the workspace, Lilaya turns to face you, [lilaya.speech(Right, I can explain as we go...)]
