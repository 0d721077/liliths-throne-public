	You step back and knock on the door, wondering if Lilaya ever actually gets any work done in here as both she and Rose snap around to see who's disturbing them. Lilaya's hand slips out from under Rose's dress, and they both stand up as you enter the room.
</p>
<p>
	[lilaya.speech(A-ah! [pc.name]! What can I help you with?)] Lilaya asks, clearly a little embarrassed at being caught in the middle of playing with Rose.
</p>
<p>
	[pc.speech(Well, I was wondering if you could help me out. You see, I recently had this weird experience, where I saw someone's arcane aura. A piece of it broke off and shot <i>into</i> me, and I'm not sure if it needs to be removed or anything...)] your voice trails off as you see an extremely concerned look flash across Lilaya's face.
</p>
<p>
	[lilaya.speech(Are you sure?! You absorbed someone's essence?!)] Lilaya asks, failing to conceal the worried tone in her voice.
</p>
<p>
	Rose quickly moves off to a corner of the room as Lilaya approaches you. Grabbing you by the [pc.arm], she quickly pulls you over to the same corner of the room as where she ran her first test on you. Instructing you to sit on the chair in the middle of the chalk square, she once more adjusts the floodlight-like pieces of arcane equipment at each corner.

		[pc.speech(Wait, I'm not going to lose my clothes or anything again, am I?)] you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(No, don't worry, I fixed that little problem!)] Lilaya responds, and before you get the chance to say anything else, arcane energy suddenly crackles into life around her arm, before shooting out into each of the curious instruments. A familiar bright pink flash illuminates the room, but this time, thankfully, your clothes and sight are unaffected.

		[lilaya.speech(Ok, here we go!)] Lilaya cries, and before you get the chance to say anything in response, arcane energy suddenly crackles into life around her arm, before shooting out into each of the curious instruments. A familiar bright pink flash illuminates the room, but this time, thankfully, your clothes and sight are unaffected.

<p>
	Once again, you find yourself surrounded by the shimmering pink outline of your arcane aura. This time, however, you see a strange ball of energy orbiting your body, which looks to be the same sort of size as the shard of energy that you remember shooting into you. Looking up at Lilaya, you see that her face has completely drained of colour, and she's displaying an extremely worried expression.
