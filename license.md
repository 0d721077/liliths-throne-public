Until I can figure out a more permissive license that will protect you, the player, from having to pay for modded copies of the game, I'm going to keep Lilith's Throne under default copyright protection. I want to enable mods for the game, but I also don't want modders to try and take advantage of players (by adding a paywall to their mods). I'll try and get a license sorted out as soon as I can (and any help or advice on this front would be very much appreciated).
